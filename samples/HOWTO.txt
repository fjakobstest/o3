  bounce.html :
  =============== 
  only for the oxs version of the site specific browser (ssb)
 
  o3.js : 
  =========
  Javascript helper file to detect and load the o3 plugin, see it in use in ssb_start.html or testplugin.html
 
  -ssb_start.html : 
  =================
  Default example for the windos version of the ssb. To execute it, start ssb (or ssb_dbg) in the same folder with this file,
or start ssb from the command line with the full path to this file as argument (i.e. ssb.exe C:\Development\o3\samples\ssb_start.html),
or simply drag and drop the html file on the ssb.exe in your explorer.
  Note: that by default, the msvc ssb project as a post build step will append resource files to the executable. Those files
can be then aquired via the o3 protocol (see comments in the example), if you want to append different files to the ssb
check out src\ssb\addResources.bat + src\ssb\ssb_resources.js files how to do it

  testplugin.html : 
  ====================
  -Windows: First you have to build the plugin, then the installer projects. Then you have to run the installer (o3plugin.exe or o3plugin_dbg.exe) 
and after the plugin installed on your machine you can just open this html file with your browser.
  -OSX:

  whatis.js :
  =============
  -Windows: Example for the command line version. Build project sh. Run sh.exe (or sh_dbg.exe) from the comman line client with this script file as the 
second and some word you would like to look up from wikipedia as the third parameter. 
(i.e. sh.exe C:\Development\o3\samples\whatis.js Github)
